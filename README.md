# What?
This is a simple script to parse the PrivateMessages table in `messaging.db` (as generated by [`slskd`](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/) at `/var/slskd/data/messaging.db`) and, if a new message was received, print it (and/or its metadata) to stdout.

The optional flag `--watch` will continually poll `messaging.db-wal`, and when its modtime changes, read the newest message from `messages.db`. If the message is newer than previously seen, it's printed to stdout. This behavior is akin to `tail -f`.

See `--help` for all flags and behaviors.

# Why?
Because [`slskd`](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/) has no native feature for sending email notifications upon new messages - so I cooked this up myself.

This script doesn't handle email, or any kind of notification delivery - it just outputs to stdout. Adapt this script to suit your own purposes, or setup your own email delivery.
